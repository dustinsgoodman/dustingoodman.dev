title: My Engineering Leadership Recommended Reading List
description: >
  I was on the Compressed.fm podcast the other day and was asked for my recommended reading list for engineering leaders/managers. I've been recommending these to a lot of people recently so I threw together my list to share out. I hope you enjoy some of these!

I've had a lot of recent conversations with some folks who all have been asking me what books I read as an engineering leader. This is my current recommended reads with a little blurb about why for each.

## Engineering Management for the Rest of Us by Sarah Drasner

Purchase Link: https://www.engmanagement.dev/

This is probably my #1 recommendation to all engineers and engineering managers. I've now read this book twice and I've gained something new with each read through. I think this is going to be an annual re-read for me because it's so easy to read but because it has helped center me as a manager. Sarah does a great job helping everyone on a team understand what is the manager's role but also how to get the most out of the relationship. I think if re-titled to "Engineering Leadership for the Rest of Us" this book would have an equally good value because it really does explore how we can all work together to build stronger teams and products.

## The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You by Julie Zhuo

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/1sKoYrs

This one was recommended to me by [Rob Ocel](https://bsky.app/profile/robocel.bsky.social) when we first started working together because I was still relatively new to management and this was a great kick starter. Julie shares the perspective of someone new to management in general from her time joining Facebook as a design intern to becoming a manager of peers. It talks through navigating some of those challenges and is one I'd recommend for ICs looking to make the jump to manager.

## The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change by Camille Fournier

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/8VmPmbZ

I just recently finished reading this one and absolutely learned a ton from it. Camille takes us on the journey of growing from a junior IC to a tech executive. She walks us through what the role is at each level, how it transforms from the previous roles, and how your relationship can look to your team and vice versa. I'd say before this read, I didn't really understand the major differences between Director and VPs of engineering compared to the CTO and now I have a greater appreciation for what each role looks like at different stages of a company.

<Note>
If you can only pick up one of these books, get Sarah's book but if you can, read all 3! These were invaluable to me for different reasons and I think you would enjoy them all.

## The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business by Erin Meyer

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/1niy5qN

If you're going to be managing people from diverse cultures or people from around the world, this is a must read. Erin lays out the information you need to navigate world culture norms that differ from your own. I'm from the South of the USA where "yes sir", "yes ma'am", and "bless your heart" are common, but these same terms aren't received the same by people in other regions of the US much less outside the US! This book really helped me hurdle managing in an international environment.

## No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention by Reed Hastings & Erin Meyer

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/bMggBvi

Erin gets a second slot on this list because she writes exceptionally well and when paired up with Netflix CEO, Reed Hastings, it takes all the lessons from "The Culture Map" and gives it a whole new meaning. This book is an insight to how Netflix has created such a standout corporate culture. This is less about engineering and more about operations but all the same lessons can be applied and really give you some perspective on what autonomy can really mean in the workplace.

## Radical Candor: Fully Revised & Updated Edition: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity by Kim Scott

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/fcdSySn

This book exploded throughout workplaces when it came on the market and for good reason. Learning how to give feedback without being an asshole is an important lesson. As Kim says in the book, radical candor doesn't give you an excuse to be a jerk. It helps you find a means to effectively help your team grow and receive feedback. Honestly, this is a must read if radical candor gets thrown around as a term in your office because you should hear what the intent of it is, not how your workplace has implemented it. I recommend this to individuals at all levels, not just managers!

## Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/69IkNmE

As your teams grow and your business accelerates, making rapid decisions is important but what is "too rapid" that can lead you to disaster? Malcolm's Blink helps explore the psychology behind this but also helps you learn about checking in with yourself during stressful situations to avoid unnecessary conflict or pain. I recommend this to individuals at all levels.

## Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead by Brene Brown

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/9se2Lto

If you haven't heard of this book, you have now! Vulnerability can be your best friend in life and will be important as you face new challenges. A former manager of mine recommended this and it was worth the read. I didn't love the audio book if I'm being completely honest so buy the paperback and take the time to read it. This reshaped how I approached relationships in general. The lessons will be uncomfortable to experience for the first time, but once you do them, you'll never turn back!

## Extreme Ownership: How US Navy Seals Lead and Win by Jocko Willink & Leif Babin

Purchase Link: https://a.co/d/bkMwjcH

This may sound like a weird addition to this list but it was probably my first step to becoming a manager years ago. A former CTO had all the engineering leads read this book during a period where there were a lot of excuses as to why things weren't getting done. It was a moment of stress and turmoil for our group and this changed our perspective a bit. After reading this, we each started to take more responsibility over what wasn't going right in our respective areas and started moving to winning again. It's been a while since I read it but I remember liking the lessons even if they were a bit *extreme*.


I'm sure you have some great books of your own and I'm sure I'll read more in the future but these are my current picks and recommendations for those looking to get into engineering management. I hope you enjoy these great books!

Some other recommendations akin to this list but not exactly belonging here:

- [The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim](https://a.co/d/3FxuDpo)
- [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](https://a.co/d/4spbsO9) - trigger warning but really good
- [Delivered From Distraction: Getting the Most Out of Life with Attention Deficit Disorder by Edward M. Hallowell M.D. & John J. Ratey M.D.](https://a.co/d/f0OaWia)
