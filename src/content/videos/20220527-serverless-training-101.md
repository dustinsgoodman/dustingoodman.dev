title: Serverless Training 101
description: >
  Serverless architectures have become increasingly popular in recent years. It enables developers to focus on building applications instead of orchestrating and managing servers. In this Javascript Marathon, Dustin Goodman shows us how we can utilize the Serverless Framework to develop and ship serverless applications to AWS. You'll learn how to configure serverless architectures, how to create functions and set up their triggers, and how to run the infrastructure locally and deploy it to production. After this session, you'll have a better understanding of how to leverage serverless to enhance your development experience.
