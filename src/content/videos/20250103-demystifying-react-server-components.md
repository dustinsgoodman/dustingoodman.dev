title: Demystifying React Server Components
description: >
  React Server Components (RSCs) have been around for over a year now and adoption has been mixed among the community. They've caused a bit of a disruption to how we think about React leading to Dan Abramov writing an article titled "The Two Reacts" that explores the paradigms of client component and server component mental models and leaves us with the thought on how we can cohesively combine these concepts in a meaningful way. RSCs enable multiple server entry points on a single page, optimizing server-side rendering, and simplifying data fetching. RSCs allow for a clearer separation between server and client functionality, enhancing both performance and maintainability. So how can we easily adopt these new paradigms and continue to effectively write usable and maintainable software? What are the side effects of using RSCs in our applications and what are the new best practices we need to consider? In this session, we're going to explore the ins and outs of these new patterns and embrace the "new" side of React.
