title: Build IT Better S01E10 - Testing (Our Patience) with Dustin Goodman
description: >
  Our very own Dustin Goodman, Engineering Manager at This Dot Labs joins Jesse Tomchak and Adam L. Barrett to talk about the path from individual contributor to people manager.

  They reminisce about the Build IT Better multiverse building an e-commerce platform. Then, they tackle testing for the JavaScript ecosystem. They discuss how the 'cold start' to testing is just too high for JavaScript, what it lacks, what developers really want for testing, what they should actually be testing.
