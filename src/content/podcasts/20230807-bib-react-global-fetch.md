  Build IT Better Unraveling the Mystery Behind React's Global Fetch Override: Devs Are Divided!
description: >
  In this episode of the Build IT Better podcast, our hosts discuss two major topics in the React and Next.js ecosystem. Firstly, they delve into the app directory architecture in Next.js and the introduction of React server components. They explore the transition from a client-first to a server-components-first approach and the challenges faced in development, particularly in managing state and toggling between server and client modes for components.

  The discussion then moves to the controversial decision of globally overriding the fetch function in React and Next.js. The hosts express frustration with this opinionated change to a fundamental standard and raise concerns about potential bugs and data leakage due to caching behavior. They also debate the best way to split server and client code, comparing file-based solutions with meta strings or decorators.

  The limitations of server components are examined, with the hosts expressing disappointment over the inability to use essential React paradigms like state on the server. They advocate for more open discussions and RFCs before implementing significant changes.

  Throughout the segment, the hosts stress the importance of thoughtful planning in dealing with server components and the need to make intentional decisions to ensure smooth development and prevent performance issues. They also call for transparency and collaboration in the development of these technologies.
