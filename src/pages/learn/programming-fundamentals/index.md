The software industry is a fantastic collection of individuals of all backgrounds and experiences which allows for an immense amount of creativity and collaboration. The software engineers you meet will have their story of how they got into the industry. Some have been programming since they were teenagers, while others had different careers prior to learning to program. Some have a formal education in mathematics or computer science, some took a coding bootcamp, and some are self-taught using online resources like [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), etc.

Personally, I have been doing some form of software development since I was in high school and have a formal degree in Computer Science from Emory University in Atlanta, GA, USA. My degree aided me in learning strong programming fundamentals. Without these fundamentals, I believe I could achieve what I've achieved in my career to date; however, I don't think I would have achieved them as quickly.

It is my personal belief that coding bootcamps and self-taught developers generally do not receive a proper education in programming fundamentals. It is my hope that this resource will prove to be a resource that gives everyone an equal opportunity to learn the fundamentals I believe have helped myself and many others excel in this field.

## Why choose this resource?

There are several great resources on the internet and in book stores that all have their merits. In my opinion, many of them focus on specific languages and techniques. This resource aims to be agnostic towards specific technologies and will demonstrate the same concepts in a variety of programming languages.

The goal of this resource is **not** to help you build your first application. However, it is geared towards giving you tools you can use to write simple programs and scripts. These building blocks are the foundation you will eventually use to build out applications. My hope is you absord the content of this book and then go utilize a tool like Codecademy to learn the specific techniques for building the type of application you want to build. The fundamentals presented should give you a deeper understanding of the future content you absorb, making furture learning endeavours easier.

## How to use this resource?

The main language choosen is Python. This is due to three main reasons:

1. It has a very accessible language syntax.
1. It enforces the teaching of proper indentation immediately.
1. Certain syntax choices the language has help teach certain concepts more easily.

However, all examples will be accompanied by examples in Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java. If you would like to see examples in other languages, please let me know in [the project issues](https://github.com/dustinsgoodman/dustingoodman.dev/issues). I've chosen these languages because I have direct experience with them and think they will help demonstrate all the concepts I hope to teach.

**I strongly encourage you to read the content of this resource and focus in on a single language.** However, some readers will be enthusiastic and want to see how the same code snippet looks in other languages. I urge caution as this can cause confusion when learning your first new language. I encourage you to pick a language before you begin to read and only use that language in this resource. The language selector will persist your choice on your current computer and browser.
