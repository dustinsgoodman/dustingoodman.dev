  GraphQL is not just a buzzword, but is a useful tool for both front and backend teams to be able to work more effectively together.

We’ll show you tools like GraphiQL, GraphQL Playground, and Apollo for testing and building your APIs. Additionally, you’ll learn best practices to avoid common mistakes when developing your GraphQL API.
