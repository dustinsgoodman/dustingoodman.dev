title: Building a Multi Platform Community Engagement Tool
description: >
  We’re building a community forum for our consumers to discuss our products here at A Latte Java. This is going to be a new greenfield project that is a companion app to our ecommerce site. Our team has determined that we really need both desktop and mobile presences and need to get a MVP to market in the next 3 months so we’re on a relatively tight timeline.


  For this, we’re starting with just the basic product idea and are having our first round table discussion to think through the requirements and identify options for creating our solution. The only requirements from the business is to generate a space where people can safely discuss how they use our products and share their how-to guides.
