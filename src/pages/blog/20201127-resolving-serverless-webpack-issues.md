title: Resolving Serverless Webpack Issues
description: >
  My team started running into memory issues when building a serverless infrastructure with webpack that impacted both local development and our ability to deploy to AWS via CircleCI. Through my debugging, I learned quite a few important lessons for those considering the Serverless Framework relating to project and file structure and other key optimizations that your team may want to consider.


  I'll discuss some techniques and tools I used and share some of the lessons I learned along the way.
